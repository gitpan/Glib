This is the debian package for the Glib module.
It was created by James Curbo <James Curbo <hannibal@adtrw.org>> using dh-make-perl.

This module was downloaded from http://gtk2-perl.sf.net/

The upstream author is:

muppet, <scott at asofyet dot org>, who borrowed heavily from the work
of GÃ¶ran Thyni, <gthyni at kirra dot net> and Guillaume Cottenceau
<gc at mandrakesoft dot com> on the first gtk2-perl module, and from
the sourcecode of the original gtk-perl and pygtk projects.  Marc Lehmann
<pcg at goof dot com> did lots of great work on the magic of making
Glib::Object wrapper and subclassing work like they should..
