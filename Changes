Revision history for Perl extension Glib.

0.02  Sun May 18 12:20:27 EDT 2003
	- renamed from G to Glib to be a good CPAN citizen.
	- broke the gtk2-perl-xs tree from a monolithic build to a
	  componentized build, so change log entries will be in ChangeLog
	  in this directory from now on.

0.01  Mon Mar 31 15:15:34 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
