Overview of Changes in 1.040
============================

  Since 1.02x (the previous stable series)
  ----------------------------------------
  * Updated build requirement
    - ExtUtils::Depends >= 0.2
  * Support for a few new API features in glib-2.4.x.
  * Functions that use GErrors in C throw magical Glib::Error exception
    objects; these objects overload the stringification operator, so old code
    won't be broken, but new code can match errors without worrying about
    translated error messages.  User code and other extensions can register
    their own error domains.  See the Glib::Error manpage for more info.
  * Glib::Type enhancements
    - Perl code can register enum and flags types for use as Glib::Object
      property types.
    - During Glib::Object class initialization, invoke INIT_BASE in the
      object's package, if it exists.  (Analogue for GTypeClass's base_init.)
    - It is now possible to add GInterface implementations to Glib::Object
      types derived in Perl code.
    - New param spec, Glib::ParamSpec::scalar
  * Glib::MakeHelper is generally more helpful.
  * The POD generation tools allow specification of cumulative data type
    descriptions, and much finer control over the format and content of the
    generated documentation.
  * Glib can now export useful constants on request.
  * New versioning API, see Glib::version.

  Since 1.0391
  ------------
  * Nothing.  :-)

Overview of Changes in 1.0391
=============================

* Bump 2.3.x version checks to 2.4.0.
* Portability fixes for Glib::MakeHelper.
* Add, document, and test Glib::GET_VERSION_INFO.
* Documentation fixes.

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.039
=================================

* Add missing symbols to the exports list, so we have half a hope of not
  totally barfing on win32.  [muppet]
* Code sweep for FIXMEs resulted in miscellaneous bugfixes and cleanups.
  - Clean up properly when croaking on bad property name in Glib::Object::new.
  - Use the same 'bad property' message in Glib::Object::set and "::new.
  - Document the fact that Glib::ParamSpec::param_spec is unimplemented.
* Document functions that can throw Glib::Error exceptions.  [Ross]
* Glib::MakeHelper enhancements  [muppet]
  - verify that ExtUtils::Depends is >= 0.2
  - Don't generate broken makefiles if there are no C or XS files to compile.
* Using Data::Dumper on an object with tied write-only properties no longer
  results in an crash.  [Ross]

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.038
=================================

* The API is frozen at this release for the 1.04x series.
* g_main_depth (new in 2.3.5) bound as Glib::main_depth.  [Ross]
* Glib::GenPod now works with strict, no user-visible changes.  [Ross]
* POD updates.  [muppet]

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.037
=================================

* Added bindings for missing utility functions, with tests and doc:
  g_get_user_name, g_get_real_name, g_get_home_dir, g_get_tmp_dir,
  g_get_application_name, g_set_application_name.  [muppet]
* Decided on versioning API, implemented, used, and documented it.  There's
  more documentation on the versioning stuff than code to implement it.
  New functions:  Glib->CHECK_VERSION, Glib::MAJOR_VERSION,
  Glib::MINOR_VERSION, Glib::MICRO_VERSION, Glib->check_version,
  Glib::major_version, Glib::minor_version, Glib::micro_version.
  [Ross, muppet]
* GPerlClosure's exception handlers no longer clobber $_.  [muppet]
* Add the ability to register new error domains and throw Glib::Errors from
  Perl.  New utility function, Glib::Error::matches (binding for
  g_error_matches), makes it easy to test errors.  New xs utility function
  for parsing a perl data structure into a GError.  [muppet]
* POD generation cleanups and fixes and enhancements.  [Ross]
  - Methods are now sorted for readability
  - Plain functions get proper non-method signatures
  - Hiding works better, more extensibly
  - Can now specify where in the file the POD should code.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes.  [Torsten, Ross, muppet]

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.036
=================================

* GErrors are now translated into exception objects instead of plain,
  translatable strings; this is implemented as an additional functionality, 
  so there is no break in either API or ABI.  [muppet]
* gperl_alloc_temp() now complains but does not crash when requested to
  allocate less than 1 byte.  [Torsten]
* Quell some doc generation noisiness.  [muppet]
* Updated copyright information in source code.  [muppet]

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.035
=================================

* Updated ExtUtils::Depends requirement to 0.200.
* Added Glib::MakeHelper::postamble_docs_full(), a more featureful, easier
  to use, and more scalable front-end to the pod documentation generation
  tools.  [muppet]
* Extended Glib::Type::list_properties to handle properties on GInterfaces,
  which is a new feature in gtk+ 2.4.  [Ross]
* Added Glib::ParamSpec::scalar() for creating SV properties without needing
  to know about boxed types.  [Ross]

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.034
=================================

* Added infrastructure for installing Perl implementations of GObject vfuncs.
  [muppet]
* Added infrastructure for adding GInterfaces to perl-derived GObject types.
  [muppet]
* Added GPerlArgv utilities for unified @ARGV handling.  [Torsten]
* Added startup-time linked version checking.  [Ross]
* Several 64-bit portability fixes.  [muppet]

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.033
=================================

* apidoc improvements, GenPod/ParseXSDoc. ability to add to the list of
  see_also, and ways to orverride the copyright globals that GenPod uses.

Overview of Changes in Glib 1.031
=================================

* New typemaps for gshort and gushort. [Torsten]
* Updates to Glib::MakeHelper fix some build issues. [Ross]
* Robustness fixes in the doc system's xs parser. [muppet]
* Added $object->freeze_notify and $object->thaw_notify. [muppet]
* Added a few new exportable constants. [muppet]

Overview of Changes from Glib 1.02x to 1.030
============================================

* MakeHelper's utilities now allow "disable-doc" on a Makefile.PL command-line
  to disable doc generation.  This works for all Glib::MakeHelper-based
  projects.
* It is now possible to register new GFlags and GEnum types from Perl.
  These are typically useful as types for object properties of perl-derived
  GObjects.
* We now compile cleanly and pass tests on x86_64 platforms.  Some
  tests are skipped until bugfixes in glib hit mainstream.
  Thanks to Jacek Konieczny.
* Added documentation for tie_properties.
* ParseXSDoc now supports continuation lines in xsubs, and properly hides
  things that want to be hidden.
* Invocation of signal and event handlers no longer clobbers $@ at the
  application level.  Thanks to Thierry Vignaud.
* Added version information APIs.
* Added filename_to_uri and filename_from_uri, but they have problems with
  localization.  Need help debugging this.
* Glib is now a proper Exporter, and can export the filename utilities.
  We also allow method invocation of those functions to quell controversy.
